						<h2> Introduction</h2>
						<br />
						<p>Allow me to introduce myself once . I am Reuben Brock, now in the third year of my journey, actively pursuing a Bachelor of Education (Secondary)/Arts (Technology). The last six years have been an incredible ride in the IT industry, but a desire for change and growth has led me to venture into the world of Design and Technology teaching. Throughout my life, making, designing, and creating have been my true passions, a fact that's reflected in my subject choices during my school days.
						<br />
						My academic adventure has been enriched by the guidance of exceptional teachers who instilled in me a profound appreciation for the art of teaching. As time passed, the dream of becoming an educator gradually solidified into a tangible reality, fueled by reflection, meticulous planning, and shifts in the political landscape.
						<br />
						As I progress on this exciting path, my ultimate goal is to become an outstanding Design and Technology teacher, specializing not only in Timber & Textiles but also in Graphics & Multimedia. I am deeply committed to inspiring young Australians from diverse backgrounds, empowering them to unleash their creative potential and shape a world of boundless innovation through Design and Technology.
						<br />
						Within this portfolio, you'll discover more about my journey - my background, my beliefs, and the driving force behind my teaching practice. Additionally, I've meticulously curated sections that include sample lessons and exemplary major works, showcasing the practical application of my expertise in both Timber & Textiles and Graphics & Multimedia.
						<br />
						To ensure I'm well-prepared for the challenges ahead, I've undertaken a thorough exploration of the knowledge and skills essential to teach NSW Stage 4 (year 7-8) Technology Mandatory. Alongside this, I've conducted a comprehensive self-audit, identifying potential areas of growth, and embracing the responsibilities that come with the unique professional position of a Design and Technology teacher.
						<br />
						With a firm commitment to continuous improvement, I've developed a robust professional learning plan, meticulously following the SMART Framework. This plan is designed to further hone my skills and expertise in both specializations, allowing me to provide the best possible education and mentorship to my future students.
						<br />
						Join me on this exhilarating journey as I continue to pursue my passion for education, igniting the spark of creativity and nurturing young minds. Together, we'll craft a world where imagination knows no limits and where the innovative spirit of Design and Technology shapes a brighter tomorrow.
