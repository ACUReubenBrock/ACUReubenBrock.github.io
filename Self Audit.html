											<h3>Skills Breakdown</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Being a teacher is far more than just a job. Teaching offers unique responsibilities and the opportunity to profoundly influence lives in ways many other professions can't claim. This holds especially true for Design and Technologies educators. The national D&T curriculum is comprehensive, allowing students to critically evaluate design processes and conceptualise solutions for a better future. They are expected to consider many aspects, from sustainability, ethics, and safety to globalisation and societal needs (ACARA, 2019). This curriculum depth underscores the vast expertise required to teach Design and Technologies, fostering design thinking, innovation, and creativity among young Australians. Design and Technology educators are privileged to nurture innovation, mould students into informed designers of their future, and ignite their creativity and confidence.</p>
										<p>The Mparntwe Declaration lays out an educational vision for young Australians, emphasising the development of confident, creative lifelong learners who are active, informed community members (Educational Council, 2019). Design and Technologies and its educators are perfectly positioned to realise this vision. The essence of Design and technology instruction is the joy of witnessing a student's pride in a completed project or their resilience in overcoming challenges. Moreover, Design and Technologies stands at the nexus of technological innovation, constantly evolving and sparking genuine curiosity among students. Price-Mitchell (2015) aptly mentioned that curiosity is the foundation of lifelong learning. Design and Technology educators must highlight contemporary Digital Technology's significance in this digital age.</p>
										<p>According to the Department of Industry, Science, and Resources (2018), digital technologies promise enormous dividends for the Australian economy and society. They have pinpointed sectors like Agriculture, Manufacturing, Mining, and Education where digital technologies will add immense value. The emphasis on Digital Technologies by the Department of Education and Training Victoria (2019) and the NSW Department of Education (2022) reinforces its importance. These entities have crafted resources for integrating digital technologies into teaching. Such integration is integral to D&T instruction, underlining the national imperative for young Australians to be proficient in digital technologies. Modern D&T educators must embrace this role, passionately educating students on the nuances of the digital realm.</p>

										<a href="Resources.html" class="image featured"><img src="images/nsw logo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Under the NSW Department of Education, public schools strongly champion the importance of Digital Technology. Their alignment with directives from the Department of Education and Training Victoria (2019) and the NSW Department of Education (2022) ensures that students remain on the cutting edge of technological innovation. These schools, closely following the comprehensive national D&T curriculum outlined by ACARA, have a pivotal role in cultivating design thinking, creativity, and innovation. Furthermore, by echoing the aspirations of the Mparntwe Declaration, they are strategically poised to nurture the next generation of innovative thinkers and informed designers.</p>

											<h3>Catholic Schools</h3>

										<a  class="image featured"><img src="images/catholic schools.jpg" alt="" /></a>

										<p>Catholic schools strike a balance between integrating modern Digital Technology and upholding their religious ethos. While they navigate the state's digital guidelines, they weave Catholic teachings seamlessly into the curriculum, providing students with a rich tapestry of faith and academic insights. In addition to their core religious teachings, there's an inherent potential for fostering innovation. By acknowledging the value of contemporary design and technology in education, these schools can be seen as places where tradition meets modernity, encouraging students to be spiritually grounded and forward-looking.</p>

											<h3>Independent Schools</h3>
										</header>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/ais.jpg" alt="" /></a>

										<p>Independent schools, known for their autonomy, have the flexibility and agility to weave Digital Technologies into their curricula in novel ways. This customisation, rooted in their unique educational philosophies, can make them pioneers in promoting digital literacy and technological prowess. While adhering to state benchmarks, their curriculum often carries distinct focal points. This can amplify areas like D&T, providing students with specialised knowledge and skills. Standing at the crossroads of pedagogical innovation, these institutions are well-equipped to stimulate creativity, teach design thinking, and foster a profound understanding of technology in their students.</p>
