												<p>As a child, I found immense joy in crafting Treehouses, Slingshots, Downhill Carts, Costumes, Computers, and Games, each project varying in success. Collaborating with like-minded individuals who shared my passion for designing, planning, and creating was always exhilarating. But what truly sparked my soul was not the completion of these creations but the joy, fun, and usefulness they brought to others. It was this deep sense of fulfillment and passion that ultimately led me to pursue a career change into the world of Design and Technology teaching.</p>
												<p>Design and Technology, to me, is more than just a subject; it's a realm of boundless possibilities where real-world applications and innovations are continuously evolving. My vision is to infuse the latest cutting-edge advancements into my teaching, empowering students with limitless potential. I aspire to explore exciting areas within my classes, such as the versatile uses of coding across all technology disciplines and helping students become confident in harnessing the potential of CNC machines, laser cutters, and 3D printers.</p>
												<p>However, my ultimate aim goes beyond merely teaching the technical aspects. I strive to ignite a passion for Design and Technology that extends beyond the classroom, encouraging students to devise thoughtful solutions to real-world problems, particularly in the realm of sustainability. I want to nurture innovation, backed by a genuine appreciation for the intricacies of designing and crafting things by hand.</p>
												<p>In a world where technology shapes the very fabric of our lives, I firmly believe that students must have the confidence to navigate their own futures. The technology classroom becomes a platform for growth, where they can learn new and emerging technologies, analyze and evaluate existing systems, and design and create their own projects. Through this process, they will not only develop essential technical skills but also become the captains of their destiny, equipped to embrace the ever-changing landscape of the modern world.</p>
												<p>As I embark on this journey as a Design and Technology teacher, my aspiration is to ignite the flame of creativity and self-assurance in each student, inspiring them to craft their own path and shape a brighter future for themselves and the world they inhabit. Together, we will explore the frontiers of innovation, where imagination knows no bounds and possibilities are endless.</p>

										<p>In this TED Talk, Michael Mieni, the first-ever Indigenous IT honours graduate at the University of Technology Sydney, emphasises the importance of integrating Aboriginal traditions to address the technological gap in Indigenous communities. Through this approach, he believes we can uncover hidden potential and talent.</p>

											<h3>Maori Craftsmanship</h3>

										<p>In this video, Broxh unveils the Maori origin tale of woodcarving, a narrative that deeply resonates with my personal journey to becoming a design and technology teacher as a Maori. Broxh recounts the near loss of our shared culture and the instrumental role of woodcarving in its resurgence. This connection between heritage, art, and education is a poignant reminder of the significance of preserving and teaching our traditions.	<p>

											<h3>The New Classroom</h3>

										<iframe width="autosize" height="autosize" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/51ENa5J9C_s" title="Australia: Developing high-tech skills at school (Learning World: S5E36, 1/3)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>Modern educational facilities, such as advanced Design Technology workshops, prototyping and robotics labs, and interactive, tech-enabled collaboration tools, are pivotal in design education. By transitioning from traditional classrooms to individual learning pods and collaborative spaces, educators can champion project-based learning. This integrated approach not only elevates the teaching of design but also underscores the indispensable role of technology in preparing students for a rapidly evolving design-centric future.</p>
